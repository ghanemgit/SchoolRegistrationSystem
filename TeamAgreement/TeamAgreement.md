## Conflict Plan

#### Each member of the group is able to complete all the parts, but we distributed these parts to avoid disagreements.

#### All members are obligated to their own tasks.  In case the not working , they will be notified twice and then the complaint will be submitted to the lecturer.

#### We will approach each other and the challenges of the project as you know that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level, so we will give every person in the group his proper task in his good knowledge.
## Communication Plan

#### To contact me, I will be available from Sunday to Thursday from 10 AM until sunset, and I’ll be available on Slack app, Also I’ll install GitHub app on my phone to receive notifications when the members pushed their work.
#### I will leave each member of the group the freedom to choose a time to break, because I do not know exactly at what time the member works, is it possible during the day or possible at night
#### My strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard is by make every day short meeting to receive all notes from the members.
## Work Plan
#### We will create a wireframe, and then we will take all hard code in our project and split it evenly distribute the tasks to the team based on difficulty.
### I will use the trello platform to manage this.
